# üöÄ Push to GitHub - Instructions

Your Alumni Ecommerce project is ready to push to GitHub!

**Repository:** https://github.com/Helencristhim/Ecommerce_Alumni

‚úÖ **Already Done:**
- Git repository initialized
- All files committed
- Remote repository added
- Branch: `main`

## üì§ Option 1: Push Using GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Alumni Ecommerce"
4. Select scopes: Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Configure Git and Push

```bash
cd /Users/helenmendes/alumni-ecommerce

# Set remote to HTTPS
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Helencristhim/Ecommerce_Alumni.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username:** Helencristhim
- **Password:** [Paste your Personal Access Token]

## üì§ Option 2: Push Using SSH Keys

### Step 1: Check if you have SSH keys

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have SSH keys.

### Step 2: Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
# Press Enter to accept default location
# Enter a passphrase (optional)
```

### Step 3: Copy your SSH public key

```bash
# For macOS
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy

# Or manually copy the output of:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Step 4: Add SSH key to GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Title: "MacBook Pro"
4. Paste your key
5. Click "Add SSH key"

### Step 5: Test and Push

```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# You should see: "Hi Helencristhim! You've successfully authenticated..."

# Push to GitHub
cd /Users/helenmendes/alumni-ecommerce
git push -u origin main
```

## üì§ Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Sign in to GitHub
3. Add existing repository: `/Users/helenmendes/alumni-ecommerce`
